<h2 class="h1" style="color: rgb(1,92,171)" id="about">About Me </h2>

My name is <b>Mohammad Reza Rohanipoor</b>. I am a researcher in <b>Reliable Embedded System Design Laboratory (RESD)</b>, Iran. I received my MSc degree in Computer Engineering, Computer Architecture major, from the Department of Computer Engineering at Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman (SBUK), Iran, in 2017.  I did my Master's project under the supervision of <b>Professor Behnam Ghavami</b>. Previously, I received my BSc degree in Computer Engineering, Computer Hardware, from SBUK, in 2013. As a result of my successful Master's education and because of my research achievements, I became a member of <b>Iran's National Elites Foundation (INEF)</b>, in 2017. 

My research interests include Reliable Systems, Computer Architecture, Digital Systems Design, Embedded Systems, Parallel Processing, and Deep Learning. 

I love volleyball, mountain climbing, photography, and music.

<!-- **ACCESSIBILITY IN AUDIO PRODUCTION FOR PEOPLE WITH VISION IMPAIRMENTS**   -->
<!-- *Advisor: [Anne Marie Piper](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~ampiper/){:target="_blank"}* -->

<!-- In this project, I'm interested in understanding how people with vision impairments use mainstream and custom-made software and hardware tools to produce audio content. Taking their current work practices into account, I aim to design accessible tools to support their workflow. -->


<!-- <h3 class="h2">Past Projects</h3> -->
<!-- **DESIGN OF SMART TECHNOLOGIES FOR CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER**     -->
<!-- *Advisors: [Shameem Ahmed](https://facultyweb.cs.wwu.edu/~ahmeds/){:target="_blank"}  and  [Moushumi Sharmin](https://facultyweb.cs.wwu.edu/~sharmim/){:target="_blank"}* -->

<!-- In this project, we did a systematic literature review and qualitative coding of scholarly articles regarding smart technologies (wearables, smartphones, VR devices etc.) designed to support autistic children. We devised a set of design implications to guide the development of autism support smart technologies.   -->
<!-- <br/> -->
<!-- **DEVELOPMENT OF TESTING METHODS FOR VEHICLE ROAD DEPARTURE MITIGATION SYSTEMS**   -->
<!-- *Advisor: [Stanley Chien](https://et.iupui.edu/people/schien){:target="_blank"}* -->

<!-- In this project sponsored by [Toyota Collaborative Safety Research Center](https://www.toyota.com/csrc/){:target="_blank"}, I worked on the development of standard testing equipment and methods to evaluate the performance of Road Departure Mitigation systems of self-driving vehicles.   -->
